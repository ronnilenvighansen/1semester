/* Write a method called wordLengths that accepts a Scanner for an input file as its parameter. Your method should open the given file,
count the number of letters in each token in the file, and output a result diagram of how many words contain each number of letters.
For example, consider a file containing the following text:

Before sorting:
13 23 480 -18 75
hello how are you feeling today

After sorting:
-18 13 23 75 480
are feeling hello how today you

Your method should produce the following output to the console. Use tabs so that the stars line up:

1: 0
2: 6 ******
3: 10 **********
4: 0
5: 5 *****
6: 1 *
7: 2 **
8: 2 **

Assume that no token in the file is more than 80 characters in length. */
